Understanding Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) Plans
Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) plans are comprehensive documents that outline an organisation's strategies and procedures for managing and mitigating workplace risks and hazards. These plans are crucial for safeguarding the health and well-being of employees, ensuring compliance with legal requirements, and promoting a culture of safety and responsibility within the organisation.

Background and Justification for OHS Plans
This chapter establishes the legal foundation for OHS plans in South Africa. We explore the constitutional right to a safe work environment, delve into the Occupational Health and Safety Act, and examine international standards like OHSAS 18000 and ISO 45000 that guide effective OHS management.

Constitutional Provisions: The Constitution of South Africa, specifically Section 24, enshrines the right to a safe and healthy environment. This constitutional provision underscores the importance of OHS and the legal obligation of businesses to ensure a safe working environment for their employees.
Statutory Justification with OHS Specific Legislation: The Occupational Health and Safety Act (Act No. 85 of 1993) is the primary legislation governing OHS in South Africa. This legislation sets out the legal requirements for employers to provide a safe working environment, conduct risk assessments, and implement appropriate control measures to mitigate workplace risks and hazards.
Standards: OHSAS 18000 and ISO 45000: OHSAS 18001 and ISO 45001 are internationally recognized standards that provide a framework for implementing and maintaining effective Occupational Health and Safety Management Systems (OHSMS). These standards help organisations to identify, assess, and manage OHS risks, improve OHS performance, and demonstrate compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.

Advantages of Having an OHS Plan
The benefits of a strong OHS plan are multifaceted. We'll examine how it safeguards employee well-being, minimises legal risks, boosts productivity, and ultimately enhances your company's reputation and brand image.

Enhanced Employee Safety and Well-being: A well-implemented OHS plan can significantly reduce workplace accidents and injuries, thereby protecting the physical and mental well-being of employees.
Legal Compliance and Risk Management: An OHS plan ensures compliance with OHS legislation, standards, and best practices, reducing the risk of legal liabilities, penalties, and sanctions.
Improved Productivity and Performance: A safe and healthy work environment promotes employee satisfaction, morale, and productivity, contributing to organisational success and competitiveness.
Enhanced Employee Relations: Prioritising employee safety demonstrates your commitment to their well-being. This fosters trust and strengthens your relationship with employees, resulting in a more positive and collaborative work culture.
Reduced Insurance Costs: Companies with a demonstrably strong OHS program can often leverage lower insurance premiums. A consistent safety record indicates a lower risk of accidents and injuries, making your business a more attractive proposition for insurance companies.
Enhanced Reputation and Brand Image: Demonstrating a commitment to OHS can enhance the organisation's reputation, build trust with stakeholders, and attract and retain clients and customers who prioritise safety and responsibility.

The Cost of Non-Compliance with OHS Requirements
Non-compliance with Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) requirements can have significant financial, legal, and reputational consequences for organisations. The cost of non-compliance extends beyond potential fines and penalties to include medical expenses, compensation claims, increased insurance premiums, and loss of productivity. Furthermore, non-compliance can damage an organisation's reputation, resulting in loss of clients, stakeholders' trust, and business opportunities.

Financial Costs: Non-compliance with OHS requirements can result in substantial financial costs for organisations. These costs may include fines and penalties imposed by regulatory authorities, medical expenses for injured employees, compensation claims, increased insurance premiums, and costs associated with implementing corrective measures to address identified non-compliance issues.
Legal Costs: Failure to comply with OHS requirements can lead to legal actions, lawsuits, and litigation against organisations. The legal costs associated with defending against these actions, settling claims, and compensating affected parties can be significant and detrimental to an organisation's financial stability and reputation.
Reputational Costs: Non-compliance with OHS requirements can damage an organisation's reputation, resulting in loss of clients, stakeholders' trust, and business opportunities. Negative publicity, media coverage, and public perception of an organisation's commitment to safety and responsibility can have long-lasting and detrimental effects on its brand image and market competitiveness.

OHS Requirements for Listing a Business on a Stock Exchange
For businesses listed on a stock exchange in South Africa, compliance with OHS legislation, standards, and best practices is not only a legal requirement but also a critical component of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) criteria. Investors and stakeholders increasingly consider OHS performance and practices when making investment decisions, reflecting a growing recognition of the importance of OHS in sustainable business growth and profitability.

OHS and the Companies Act
The Companies Act, 2008 (Act No. 71 of 2008) requires companies to act in the best interests of all stakeholders, including employees, shareholders, and the community. An effective OHS plan is essential for fulfilling this obligation by safeguarding the health and well-being of employees, ensuring compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, and promoting responsible and sustainable business practices.
Regardless of geographical location or industry sector, organisations worldwide can benefit from implementing effective OHS plans to protect employees, comply with legal and regulatory requirements, enhance reputation and brand image, and promote sustainable growth and profitability. As such, the importance of OHS transcends borders and should be a fundamental consideration for businesses operating in any global context.


Legal Framework and Compliance
Understanding the legal framework governing OHS plans is crucial for employers to ensure compliance and effectively manage workplace risks. The Occupational Health and Safety Act (OHSA) No. 85 of 1993 is the primary legislation in South Africa that governs OHS in workplaces. This chapter provides an in-depth analysis of the specific sections of the OHSA dealing with OHS plans and outlines the regulations explicitly requiring OHS plans.

OHS Plans under the Occupational Health and Safety Act (OHSA)
The Occupational Health and Safety Act (OHSA) No. 85 of 1993 forms the foundation for OHS management in South Africa across various sectors, excluding mining which is governed by the MHSA.  Below are the specific sections of the OHSA dealing with OHS plans:

Section 8, Duty to Provide and Maintain a Safe Working Environment: "Every employer shall provide and maintain, as far as is reasonably practicable, a working environment that is safe and without risk to the health of his employees."  Compliance to this section can be demonstrated with the development and implementation of an OHS Plan showing the employer has implemented measures to provide and maintain a safe working environment.
Section 9, Duties of Employers to Non-Employees:  "Every employer shall conduct his undertaking in such a manner as to ensure, as far as is reasonably practicable, that persons other than those in his employment who may be directly affected by his activities are not thereby exposed to hazards to their health or safety."  Employers must ensure that their OHS plan includes measures to protect non-employees, such as contractors, visitors, and the public, from workplace hazards.
Section 14, Duties of Employees: "Every employee shall at work—   (a) take reasonable care for the health and safety of himself and of other persons who may be affected by his acts or omissions;"   Employers must provide training and information to employees on their responsibilities for health and safety as part of the OHS plan.
Regulations of the Occupational Health and Safety Act Requiring OHS Plans
Several regulations under the OHSA require the development and implementation of OHS plans to manage and mitigate OHS Risks. This list is not comprehensive but below are the key regulations:

General Safety Regulations (GSR): Regulation 2 (1): "every employer and every user of machinery shall make an evaluation of the risk attached to any condition or situation which may arise from the activities of such employer or user, as the case may be, and to which persons at a workplace or in the course of their employment or in connection with the use of machinery are exposed, and he shall take such steps as may under the circumstances be necessary to make such condition or situation safe."
Asbestos Abatement Regulations:  Regulation 6: "asbestos -containing materials are identified, as required in regulation 3, the employer or self -employed person must ensure that a written asbestos management plan for the workplace is prepared by a competent p."  Employers must prepare a written asbestos management plan.
Construction Regulations:  
Regulation 5:  "A client must - (a) prepare a baseline risk assessment for an intended construction work project. (b) prepare a suitably, sufficiently documented and coherent site specific health and safety specification for the intended construction work based on the baseline risk assessment.
Regulation 7: “A principal contractor must - provide and demonstrate to the client a suitable, sufficiently documented and coherent site specific health and safety plan, based on the client’s documented health and safety specifications contemplated in regulation 5(1)(b), which plan must be applied from the date of commencement of and for the duration of the construction work and which must be viewed and updated by the principal contractor as work in progress”

OHS Plans under the Mine Health and Safety Act (MHSA)
The Mine Health and Safety Act (MHSA) No. 29 of 1996 serves as the cornerstone of occupational health and safety (OHS) legislation in the South African mining industry. 
The MHSA emphasises the importance of proactive safety measures through the following sections:

Section 2: This section places a duty on mine owners to ensure, as far as reasonably practicable, the health and safety of their employees. An OHS plan serves as a critical tool for fulfilling this duty by outlining a comprehensive strategy to identify, assess, and control workplace hazards.
Section 5: This section requires a Manager to maintain a healthy and safe mine environment.

Application of the Legal Framework Internationally
The principles and requirements outlined are consistent with international OHS standards and best practices. Employers worldwide can benefit from understanding and implementing similar legal requirements to ensure a safe and healthy working environment for all.



Critical Stakeholders in Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) Plans
Effective Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) planning is a collaborative effort that demands commitment and engagement from various stakeholders, both within and outside the organisation. 
These stakeholders are instrumental in the development, implementation, monitoring, and review of OHS plans, thereby fostering a safe and healthy working environment, ensuring compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, and cultivating a culture of safety and responsibility among employees.
This section further explores the roles and responsibilities of key stakeholders from the board of directors and the CEO, including senior management, OHS professionals, employees, trade unions, regulatory authorities, and external partners, in enhancing OHS planning and management within organisations.

The Board of Directors
The Board of Directors holds a pivotal role in OHS planning and management. As mandated by various legislations, including the Companies Act, King IV principles, Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) requirements, and ethical standards, the Board is responsible for:
Setting OHS Policies and Objectives: The Board is accountable for establishing clear and comprehensive OHS policies, objectives, and strategies aligned with the organisation's overall mission, vision, and values.
Overseeing OHS Performance and Compliance: The Board is responsible for monitoring and evaluating the organisation's OHS performance, ensuring compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, and addressing any identified non-compliance issues promptly and effectively.
Allocating Resources for OHS: The Board must allocate adequate resources, including finances, personnel, and technologies, to support the development, implementation, and maintenance of effective OHS management systems and initiatives.
Promoting a Culture of Safety and Responsibility: The Board plays a crucial role in promoting a culture of safety, responsibility, and continuous improvement throughout the organisation by setting a positive example, demonstrating leadership commitment to OHS, and engaging with employees and stakeholders on OHS matters.
These Responsibilities are informed by the Companies Act and King IV Principles:
Companies Act (Act 71 of 2008): In terms of the Companies Act, 2008 of South Africa, the board of directors has a fiduciary duty to ensure the health and safety of employees and stakeholders. Directors must act in good faith and in the best interests of the company, exercising the required care, skill, and diligence to protect the health and safety of individuals involved in the company's operations. They are responsible for implementing and overseeing effective health and safety policies, procedures, and practices, ensuring compliance with relevant legislation, and addressing any health and safety risks or issues that may arise within the company's operations.
King IV Principles on Corporate Governance: King IV, a corporate governance code in South Africa, emphasises the board's responsibility for the health and safety of employees and stakeholders. The board is mandated to ensure a corporate culture that promotes ethical and responsible decision-making, which includes prioritising health and safety. The board should ensure that the organisation's strategy is sustainable and should oversee the implementation of policies and practices to manage health, safety, and environmental risks effectively. The board is also responsible for ensuring compliance with applicable laws and regulations related to health and safety.

Building and maintaining a robust OHS plan requires a concerted effort from a diverse group of stakeholders.  We've explored the critical roles played by the board of directors, senior management, OHS professionals, employees, trade unions, regulatory authorities, and external partners.  Each stakeholder brings a unique perspective and set of skills to the table, and their collective commitment is essential for creating a safe and healthy work environment.
The board of directors holds a particularly influential position. Their leadership sets the tone for the entire organisation.  By actively engaging in their OHS responsibilities, as outlined in this chapter, the board demonstrates the highest ethical leadership and commitment to ESG compliance.  This translates into allocating adequate resources for OHS initiatives, holding management accountable for performance, and fostering a culture of safety and responsibility throughout the organisation.
While the specific governance frameworks may differ internationally, with some countries lacking a King IV code or a Companies Act with identical provisions, the core principles remain consistent.  International OHS standards like ISO 45001 emphasise the importance of leadership commitment, risk management, and continual improvement in safety performance.  Regardless of location, effective OHS plans require a leadership team that prioritises employee well-being, integrates safety into decision-making, and champions a culture of ethical and responsible business practices.

By fostering a collaborative environment where all stakeholders are empowered to contribute to OHS efforts, organisations can create a symphony of safety. This collaborative approach, coupled with strong leadership from the board, ensures a safe and healthy workplace for all employees, minimises legal risks, and positions the organisation for long-term success in today's globalised and ethically conscious marketplace.


Process Steps for Compilation of the OHS Plan
Developing a comprehensive OHS plan is the cornerstone of creating a safe and healthy work environment. This chapter guides you through the essential steps involved in compiling an effective OHS plan, equipping you to proactively manage workplace hazards and risks.

Legal Compliance Assessment
The journey begins with a thorough legal compliance assessment.  
Identifying all relevant OHS legislation, regulations, and standards applicable to your industry and operations. (e.g., OHS Act, Construction Regulations, Asbestos Regulations)
Examining your current practices and procedures to ensure compliance with these legal requirements.
Identifying any gaps or areas where your current practices need to be adjusted to achieve full legal compliance.
By conducting a comprehensive legal compliance assessment, you establish a solid foundation for your OHS plan, ensuring it aligns with all relevant legal obligations.

Baseline Risk Assessment
Once legal compliance is established, the next step is to conduct a comprehensive baseline risk assessment. 
Systematically identifying all potential hazards present in your workplace.
Analysing the likelihood and severity of potential harm associated with each hazard.
Evaluating the existing control measures in place to mitigate these risks.
Prioritising risks based on their severity and likelihood of occurrence.
The baseline risk assessment provides a clear picture of your workplace hazards and helps you prioritise areas where control measures need to be implemented or strengthened.

Health and Safety Policy Development
Based on the legal compliance assessment and baseline risk assessment, the organisation needs to develop a clear and comprehensive Health and Safety Policy. This policy should reflect the organisation's commitment to providing a safe and healthy working environment and comply with legal and regulatory requirements. 

Draft a Health and Safety Policy outlining the organisation's commitment, objectives, and strategies.
Review and finalise the Health and Safety Policy with input from key stakeholders, including the Board of Directors, senior management, and OHS professionals.
Communicate and distribute the Health and Safety Policy to all employees and stakeholders.

Implementation of Control Measures
Once the risks and hazards are identified and prioritised, the organisation needs to implement appropriate control measures to mitigate, reduce, or eliminate the identified risks and hazards.      

Develop and implement control measures, including engineering controls, administrative controls, and personal protective equipment (PPE).
Monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the implemented control measures.
Review and adjust the control measures as necessary to ensure continuous improvement and compliance with OHS requirements.

Induction and Training Programs
Induction and training programs are essential to ensure that all employees understand and adhere to the organisation's Health and Safety Policy, procedures, and practices. 

Develop and implement an induction program for new employees, introducing them to the organisation's OHS policies, procedures, and practices.
Conduct regular OHS training programs for all employees, focusing on specific risks, hazards, and control measures relevant to their roles and responsibilities.
Monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the induction and training programs and make necessary adjustments to enhance employee awareness and compliance.

Establishment of Health and Safety Committees
Establishing Health and Safety Committees is crucial to facilitate communication, collaboration, and consultation on OHS matters among employees, management, and other stakeholders. 

Formulate Health and Safety Committees comprising representatives from management, employees, and other stakeholders.
Define the roles, responsibilities, and functions of the Health and Safety Committees.
Conduct regular meetings and discussions to review OHS performance, address concerns, and implement improvements.

Development of Emergency Response Plans
Developing comprehensive Emergency Response Plans is essential to ensure preparedness and effective response to emergencies, incidents, and accidents within the organisation. 

Identify potential emergencies, incidents, and accidents based on the risk assessment.
Develop and implement Emergency Response Plans outlining the procedures, roles, responsibilities, and communication strategies during emergencies.
Conduct regular drills and exercises to test and evaluate the effectiveness of the Emergency Response Plans.

Construction Regulations Compliance
For organisations involved in construction activities, compliance with the Construction Regulations is crucial to ensure a safe and healthy working environment for all employees and stakeholders. 

Review and understand the Construction Regulations applicable to the organisation's activities.
Develop and implement specific OHS measures and control measures to comply with the Construction Regulations.
Monitor and evaluate compliance with the Construction Regulations and make necessary adjustments to enhance OHS performance and compliance.

Establishment of Internal OHS Department
Establishing an Internal OHS Department is essential to facilitate the development, implementation, monitoring, and review of the OHS plan, policies, procedures, and practices within the organisation. 

Formulate an Internal OHS Department comprising qualified and competent OHS professionals.
Define the roles, responsibilities, and functions of the Internal OHS Department.
Provide necessary resources, support, and training to the Internal OHS Department to enhance its effectiveness and efficiency.

Allocation of OHS Resources
Allocating adequate resources, including finances, personnel, and technologies, is crucial to support the development, implementation, and maintenance of effective OHS management systems and initiatives.

Identify and allocate necessary resources, including finances, personnel, and technologies, to support the OHS plan, policies, procedures, and practices.
Monitor and evaluate the utilisation of OHS resources and make necessary adjustments to enhance effectiveness and efficiency.
Ensure continuous investment in OHS resources to support the organisation's commitment to safety, compliance, and continuous improvement.

External Certification ISO 45001
Achieving external certification, such as ISO 45001, demonstrates the organisation's commitment to implementing and maintaining a comprehensive and effective OHS management system. 

Prepare and align the OHS management system with the requirements of ISO 45001.
Conduct internal audits and assessments to evaluate the OHS management system's compliance and readiness for external certification.
Engage an accredited certification body to conduct an external audit and assess the organisation's OHS management system against the ISO 45001 requirements.
Address any identified non-conformities and implement necessary improvements to achieve and maintain ISO 45001 certification.

In line with the requirements of the Occupational Health and Safety Act, 85 of 1993, as well as the Construction Regulations, we take the greatest care not only towards statutory requirements but also ensuring that our activities during the construction do not negatively impact the client's employees, visitors, clients, and other stakeholders, as well as the surrounding environment for the duration of the contract.

This plan will be implemented after approval by the client and will be maintained throughout the duration of the project. Measures to ensure compliance include (but not limited to):

Delegation of OHS responsibilities through legal appointments,
Risk eliminations and mitigation strategies,
COID registration as well as implementation of incident management procedures,
Emergency Response Planning to cater for all incidents from First Aid to Disasters,
Management of subcontractors,
Training and induction to ensure competency.
To ensure compliance, induction training for all entering the site will serve as prerequisites supported by continuous supervision of the site activities. In addition to specific competency requirements, ongoing training through toolbox talks will be implemented for all employees.
